    <h1>My first web page</h1>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is the basic language of the
      Interwebs.  There are three main languages used in web pages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML, which describes the content and layout of a web page,</li>
      <li>CSS (for Cascading Style Sheet), which describes how the HTML
	elements appear, and</li>
      <li>Javascript, which enables us to make dynamic changes to web
	pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      HTML is an instance of the Extensible Markup Language (XML).  The layout
      of the page is defined by the HTML <b>elements</b> that the page
      contains.  An HTML element consists of a start tag and an end tag.  For
      example, paragraphs begin with
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;p&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      and end with
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">This is
      a link to a list of HTML elements.</a>

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags">Here is another list.</a>

    <p style="background-color: blue; color: white;">
      Most of the styling of the different elements in this web page is being
      controlled by the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) file
      <a href="my.css" style="color: white;">my.css</a>.
      The styling in this element is set locally, in the web page HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
      CSS is what makes a web page look spiffy.  You should look
      in the file my.css and figure out how this works for this page.
      Here are some links with information about CSS:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">the
        Mozilla folks, who are behind the Firefox browser,</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">w3schools.com</a></li>
      </ul>
    <p>

    <h2>Examples of HTML elements</h2>
    <p>There are six levels of HTML headings.  They are intended to be
      headings for sections of a webpage.  You an control their size, font,
      color, &amp;c. using CSS.</p>
    <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
    <h2>This is a lower-level heading.</h2>
    <h3>This is a lower-lower-level heading.</h3>
    <h4>This is a lower-lower-lower-level heading.</h4>
    <h5>This is a lower-lower-lower-lower-level heading.</h5>
    <h6>This is a lower-lower-lower-lower-level heading.</h6>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph.
      So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage leaf, to make an apple pie; and at
      the same time a great she-bear coming up the street, pops its head into
      the shop. 'What! no soap?' So he died, and she very imprudently married
      the barber; and there were present the Joblillies,
      and the Garyulies, and the grand Panjandrum himself, with the little
      round button at top; and they all fell to playing the game of catch as
      catch can, till the gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots.
     </p>

    <p class="alert">
      This is a paragraph with a line break.  It also illustrates the use of
      the "class" attribute. <br/>

    <p>Here is preformatted text with its own font and font size.  With
       preformatted text we respect line breaks, &amp;c., in the text.  HTML
       otherwise ignores spaces and line breaks.</p>
    <pre class="poetry">
      The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea
      In a beautiful pea-green boat,
      They took some honey, and plenty of money,
      Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
   </pre>

    <p>
      Here is a block quote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Baseness attracts everyone.  If you see something being done suddenly by
      many people, you may assume that it is base. <br/>
      &ndash; Goethe, <i>Venetian Epigrams</i>

    <p>You can control the appearance of lists using CSS.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This is an ordered list</li>
      <li>This is an ordered list</li>
     </ol>
    <ol class="upper_roman">

      <li>This is an ordered list with a classical flair</li>

      <li>This is an unordered list</li>
